This project will develop an AI-powered project assistant to help users post and manage projects on a developer hiring platform (presumably using GoHighLevel pipelines). The assistant will automate key tasks, including project updates, GitHub repository creation, and communication with developers.

## Target Audience
This tool is designed for businesses and creators seeking to streamline their project management and developer hiring process.

## Key Features
* **Automated Project Posting:** The AI assistant will post project details to the platform based on user input.
* **Lifecycle Management:** The assistant will update the project status throughout the GoHighLevel pipeline stages.
* **GitHub Integration:** The assistant will create a GitHub repository and project page for the project prototype.
* **Automated Communication:** The assistant will email the final repository and page link to the development team.

## Technology Stack
* Gemini (for AI capabilities)
* GitHub API (for repository and page management)

## Success Criteria
A stable and bug-free application that effectively automates the described tasks.
